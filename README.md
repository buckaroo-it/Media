### About
The Buckaroo Media repository is used to keep the various logos of payment methods up-to-date as well as the Buckaroo logos. All images are free to use for Buckaroo merchants and partners.

In 2005 Buckaroo started as a Payment Service Provider in the Netherlands. In 2020 Buckaroo also opened an office in Belgium. Buckaroo was the first payment provider who offered iDEAL. The range of payment methods was quickly expanded with SEPA direct debit and credit cards. A few years later, SEPA direct debit and credit cards were added to our services. We now offer over 40 payment methods and giftcards. Weâ€™re a strategic payment partner for 12,500 businesses and organizations. We offer solutions for any question concerning payments.
